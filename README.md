## Current Status and To Do
- [x] Add medium ACR phantom compatibility to the Hazen code base.
- [x] Incorporate docker image of the Hazen code base with medium ACR compatibility.

- [x] Build a version of the GUI which does not require internet connection (to update Docker image).
- [x] Make a release package
- [ ] Build unit tests.
- [ ] Write documentation.
- [ ] get baseline values from a series of scanners
